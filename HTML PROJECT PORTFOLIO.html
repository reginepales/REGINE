      <h2></h2>
     <P>Anyeong haseyo or sawasdee in Thai.Its me Regine M.Pales, 21 years old, I'm a second year college taking the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.A girl who are strong, liberated, wacky go lucky person and I'm also a die hard fan. I think I was born a fangirl because I'll started a fan of Sarah G, Justin Beiber and Avril Lavigne since 2009.Until I took in Grade 5, my Idol in this grade was Mario Maurer.Her handsome was incomparable and his good in acting so that I idolize him so much. Another man who's stole my sadly heart was Darren Espanto.When the first I watched in the tv I'd amazed his powerful voice and charm. So thats the beggining of my undying support of Darren Espanto. Wayback junior high school english subject teacher asked me; Sir Roj: Who is your insperation? I answered: Darren Espanto and my teacher amazed me and he replied you just like Lucy Torres I saw the personality of young Lucy Torres of you,but not in your face charrot laugh.Thats the unforgettable conversation that I never forgot.Being a fan is not easy because you ever dream a man who cant be yours. And you are not an only girl who support him you are thousands and millions.I have many idols including; Exo,BTS AND Kittipat Kaewchareon and many more. I really likes fantasy movies, the first fantasy that catches my lonely self, and became my stress reliever was Harry Potter in this movies, Gave me more knowledge in english and just like the movie no matter how many bad witch you will incounter you will find a way to fight for it,because you are the main character of your own movies. In this world full of demons be an angel of God and always praise. I'm a product of broken family my mum was died when I was 7 years old and my father left and abandoned his children so that my big sister who raised me and she took me to school. And she treated my as her own children she gave me a love that I never felt in my father before. and shes my shining armor. Shes really a Goddess for me not in physical but also in spiritual. Shes the instrument of God for me so that I really need her and I love her so much.
